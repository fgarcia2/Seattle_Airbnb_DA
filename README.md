## Link for the story with Medium 
The following is the link for the story being published with Medium. 

## Context 
Airbnb has been used as a platform for managing rentals for vacations or extended stays, and is based in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

## Content 
The primary dataset contains information about listings in the Seattle area, which includes information about each property, neighborhood, ratings, etc. Additional datasets are included that capture information about reviews provided by the users and availability of the rental. 

## Installation 
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

SciPy NumPy Pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

Python Jupyter notebook has been used and is recommended for coding.

## Project Motivation 
This project will center itself in answering a number of business questions about the Seattle neighborhoods where Airbnb rentals exist using 2016-2017 rental data. The questions are as follows 

1. What are the most popular neighborhoods and room types in the Seattle area?
2. What are the price ranges of Seattle apartments by neighborhoods? What is the average daily rental price per month?
3. What is the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood?

## File descriptions 

Jupyter Notebook (Airbnb Data Analysis - Seattle.ipynb). Also supported by calendar-sea, listings-sea and reviews-sea data files. 

## Results 

Overall, the project concludes that each Seattle neighborhood is fairly unique in terms of the amenities they offer. In general, most listings are private rooms or entire apartments. Also, the average nightly rental price in each of these neighborhoods generally sits within a range of under $150/night. 

There appears to be seasonality, with the summer months resulting in higher prices of the rentals. Finally, a word cloud was created to describe the vibe of each neighborhood based on aggregating data from the reviews. The conclusion from this analysis was that different neighborhoods offer a variety of amenities such as location close to downtown, great views and proximity to public transportation.
